# Universal Auto-Deploy Workflow
# Copy this file to .github/workflows/deploy.yml in any repo
# Then run setup-auto-deploy.sh to configure secrets and variables
#
# Supports: Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend)
# Only runs jobs for which DEPLOY_VERCEL or DEPLOY_RAILWAY variables are set to 'true'
#
# Build happens on Vercel/Railway servers (not GitHub runner) for max compatibility
# with any package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
